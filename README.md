## Description

A group video chat application which facilitates peer to peer connections

In it's present state this video chat application serves as a foundationary step towards integrating some of the features I wish zoom had. Like having realtime feedback status between instructor/student roles and solving zoom limitations like maximum number of breakout rooms allowed which won't be a concern with this peer-to-peer framework..
