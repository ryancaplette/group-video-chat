## Description

A group video chat application which facilitates peer to peer connections

In it's present state this video chat application serves as a foundationary step toward integrating and solving some of the features I find zoom to be lacking for certain use cases. I built this video chat application to eventually integrate features I wish zoom had and to solve frustrating zoom limitations like maximum number of breakout rooms allowed per session which won't be a concern with this peer-to-peer framework.. (see issues tab for additional and updated examples of future feature requests)
